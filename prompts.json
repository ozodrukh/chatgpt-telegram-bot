Avoid distractions.  \n   - **Midday (Collaboration):** Use this time for meetings or teamwork.  \n   - **Afternoon (Creative/Deep Work):** Block 2–3 hours for focused project work.  \n   - **Evening (Reflection & Wellness):** Reserve the last hour for journaling, mindfulness, or light exercise.  \n\n3. **Pomodoro Technique for Sustained Focus**:  \n   - Work in 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. After 4 intervals, take a longer 15–30-minute break to recharge.  \n\n4. **Self-Care and Wellness**:  \n   - Schedule at least 30 minutes daily for physical activity or meditation.  \n   - Stay hydrated and take 10-minute breaks to stretch during the day.  \n\n5. **Weekly Review**:  \n   - Every Sunday evening, reflect on achievements, identify challenges, and adjust your schedule for the coming week.  \n\n**Tools to Use**:  \n- **Todoist or Trello:** For task management.  \n- **Google Calendar:** For time blocking and reminders.  \n- **Calm App or Headspace:** For guided meditation.  \n\nThis plan ensures productivity without neglecting self-care, creating a sustainable and fulfilling routine.
